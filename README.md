# Lunar Spectral Unmixing

My summer research internship repository for lunar mineral classification using hyperspectral data from Chandrayaan-2â€™s Imaging Infrared Spectrometer (IIRS), as part of an ISRO-funded project at the CSE Department, Nirma University.

This project explores various spectral unmixing techniquesâ€”ranging from classical algorithms to deep learning approachesâ€”to extract meaningful mineralogical information from noisy, high-dimensional hyperspectral imagery of the Moonâ€™s surface.

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure

I plan the directories to be like this, and will add stuff their accordingly

â”œâ”€â”€ data/ # Raw and intermediate hyperspectral data
|
â”œâ”€â”€ data-preprocessing/ # All preprocessing steps
|
â”œâ”€â”€ dimension-reduction/ # Deep learning-based latent space mapping
|
â”œâ”€â”€ mineral-analysis/ # Downstream mineral analysis
